# Design-Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a way to standardize and capture best practices in software development, enabling developers to solve recurring design challenges efficiently. Design patterns are not specific to a particular programming language or technology; instead, they focus on general principles and concepts that can be applied across different systems and domains.

# Classification of patterns

Design patterns can be classified into three main categories:

- **Creational Patterns:** These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, providing flexible ways to create objects while hiding the creation logic from the client.

- **Structural Patterns:** These patterns focus on organizing classes and objects to form larger structures while ensuring flexibility and ease of use. Structural patterns often involve composition and inheritance to create relationships between objects.

- **Behavioral Patterns:** These patterns address the interaction and communication between objects, defining the behavior and responsibilities of objects in various scenarios. Behavioral patterns enable the encapsulation of algorithms and communication protocols.

It's important to note that these classifications are not rigid, and some patterns may overlap or exhibit characteristics from multiple categories.

The primary goal of design patterns is to provide proven solutions for common design problems, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
